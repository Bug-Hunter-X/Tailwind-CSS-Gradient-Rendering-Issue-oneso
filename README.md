# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in using Tailwind CSS gradients.  The issue arises when the color definition in the gradient is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior. The element using the gradient may disappear or render unexpectedly without any console errors.

## Bug
The main problem lies in potential typos or missing color definitions within the gradient. If the specified color isn't defined in your Tailwind configuration, it won't render.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the specified colors in the gradient and ensuring they are defined in your Tailwind configuration. Double-check for typos.
