```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature. However, if the `to-purple-500` is not defined properly in the theme file, or if there's a typo, it might lead to unexpected behavior.  The gradient might not render correctly or the entire element might disappear without any obvious error messages.
